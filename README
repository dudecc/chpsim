This directory contains the actual code. Run
  % gmake
to recompile. Then copy "chpsim" to a standard directory, such
as /usr/local/bin/.

The program uses two libraries, clib and gmp. You should make
the clib library first (run 'make' in .. or in ../clib/Src).
The clib library will be installed in clib/$ARCH, where $ARCH
identifies your computer's architecture. You can set this
environment variable before running make. (Default: $ARCH = `uname -m`)

The gmp library is the GNU Multiple Precision library. A version
of this library is included (in ../gmp). If a newer version of the
gmp library is already installed on your system, you should change
the references to gmp in the Makefile (this directory) to that
installed version. If you get lots of error messages involving mpz_
functions, you may need to recompile the ../gmp library:

   cd ../gmp/gmp-3.1.1
   ./configure
   gmake

(The gmp library does some weird things where a prefix is added to
all exported identifiers; sometimes this causes stuff to get out
of sync.)

The chpsim program has a search path for modules. You can change
the default path by editing file path.def (before compiling).
The path is shown when running chpsim -v.

You must copy the following files to one of the directories
(preferably the first) in the module search path:

    builtin.chp
    stdio.chp
    demo1.chp
    demo2.chp
