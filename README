To install, run:

./configure
make
make install

The only external dependency of chpsim is gmp, the GNU Multiple
Precision library.  Running ./configure will search for this library
and inform you if the library or its headers could not be found.

'make install' will install the binary to /usr/local/bin, and the
default chp library files to /usr/local/share/chpsim.  Chpsim has this
directory built in as a search path.  Other directories can also be
added to the search path by adding them to path.def before compiling.
