These are libraries used in the development of the programs
for this project. These libraries themselves were not developed
under the project, and are only provided to facilitate compilation
of the programs that are part of this project.

Normally, recompilation of these libraries is not necessary: you
can link directly with the compiled versions in i686-lx/ or win32/.
